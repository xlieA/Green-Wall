# Green Wall

Thank you for playing our game "Green Wall"!

Our game idea is inspired by the Great Green Wall (GGW) of the Sahara and Sahel Initiative adapted by the African Union. The initiative aims to ultimately stop desertification and land degradation in the Sahel zone by implementing a mosaic of various locally adapted projects. These projects range from sustainable agriculture and agroforestry to reforestation, water management and soil measures such as erosion control. Local communities implement, maintain and innovate those projects as required by the local circumstances.

We incorporate these initiatives, methods and values into a strategic community and economy building game. The player manages and guides a community faced with the drastic consequences of climate change and land degradation. The player will need to implement agricultural techniques that are able to withstand the harsh environment to secure food and a living for the community. In time, they will build a network with other communities to tackle larger projects and reclaim land from the desert.

The player finds themselves in a world almost completely destroyed by the effects of climate change. Huge parts of the land are barren and uninhabitable. The soil is unable to grow any plants anymore. Most people already left their homes behind in a desperate search for a chance at a better life somewhere else. But the livable regions get less and less. The player and a small part of their community live in a vacant region that hasn't been able to sustain itself in years. In an attempt to fight imminent desertification, the player tries to lead their community in their endeavour to reclaim their home once again. Based on their research on the Great Green Wall the player develops a concept to revive the land. And that, in just four years' time.
